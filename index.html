                                I led a $10M debt treasury cycle, optimizing cash flow and forecasting accuracy while tightening audit controls—resulting in a 5% liquidity boost. Collaborating with the CEO and Board, I introduced G&A cost-cutting strategies and renegotiated contracts, slashing annual costs by $300K and improving EBITDA by 32%. Additionally, I analyzed key metrics (CAC, LTV, SEO, retention) with the VP of Operations, identifying opportunities to reduce monthly marketing spend by $400K—directly enhancing financial efficiency. Prior to this role, I implemented Oracle NetSuite ERP, cutting reporting time by 3 days while managing a team of 4 finance professionals. I also prepared and presented P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow reports to the CEO, board, and investors monthly, and streamlined payroll processing for 150+ employees (W2/1099) across multiple states using Rippling, ensuring compliance and operational efficiency.

While managing day-to-day accounting in QuickBooks Online, I oversaw month-end closes, intercompany consolidations, payroll accruals, AP/AR, inventory tracking, and reconciliations, ensuring seamless financial operations.
